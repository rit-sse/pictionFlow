A line was drawn starting at the top left corner, and I've printed the collected datapoints to the console.
Note that the relative offset starts at the top-left corner of the screen. We will have to leverage this data. Currently, the left vertical axis appears to intersect the X-axis at approximately 26.6, which we will either have to fix internally, or adjust for in the datalog we use to generate predictions.
